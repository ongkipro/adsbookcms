 * arrived during an outage is lost the moment the operator fixes the
 * credential. Nothing else in the system ever un-terminates them.
 *
 * The first version of this selected `attempts < max_attempts`, on the
 * reasoning that `decideRetry` terminates for exactly two reasons and the other
 * one increments `attempts`, so that predicate was precisely the dead-token
 * case. It was precise and too narrow. On 2026-09-03 an install started
 * getting "Object with ID … does not exist, cannot be loaded due to missing
 * permissions" on every event: a destination-side misconfiguration, entirely
 * fixable, that let 107 rows exhaust their budget honestly. Those are exactly
 * as recoverable as a token failure and that predicate excluded all of them.
 *
 * So the classification is no longer a guess about *why* a row failed. The
 * caller proves the destination works — `/api/admin/ads` sends a probe event
 * and refuses to requeue at all if Meta rejects it — and every failed row then
 * gets one more go. Meta still deduplicates on `event_id`, so a row that did
 * reach it cannot double-count.
 *
 * Two exclusions remain, and both are absolute:
 *
 * - A payload that cannot be parsed can never succeed; retrying it is waste.
 * - Meta rejects an event whose `event_time` is more than seven days old, and
 *   retries deliberately preserve the original time so a Purchase is still
 *   attributed to when it happened. Without this bound a requeue would take
 *   rows the 30-day retention still holds, send them, have Meta refuse them for
 *   being stale, and re-terminate them — spending the operator's recovery on
 *   events that could never land.
 *
 * Deliberately not automatic: resending conversions has a real advertising
 * consequence, so it stays an explicit operator decision.
