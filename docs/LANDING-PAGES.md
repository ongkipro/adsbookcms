# Building a landing page

> Verified against disk: 2026-08-22 @ `d6f08c6` + A21

There are two kinds of landing page in this CMS and they are not
interchangeable. Pick the right one before writing anything.

| | CMS landing page | Native Astro landing page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Author | an operator, in `/admin/landing-pages` | a developer or an AI terminal, in the repo |
| Lives in | D1, table `landing_pages` | `src/pages/<slug>.astro`, registered in `src/data/native-landing-pages.ts` |
| Served by | the `[slug].astro` catch-all | its own route |
| Changes need | nothing — saved and live | a build and a deploy |
| In the CMS | fully editable | listed, linkable, claimable — never editable |
| Use it when | the operator owns the copy and wants to iterate | the page needs layout or logic the builder cannot express |

## The URL contract

**Every landing page answers at `domain.com/<slug>`. There is no prefix** — no
`/landing`, no `/pages`, no `/lp`. That is the address an ad points at and the
address that gets shared.

Astro resolves a static route before a dynamic one, so a native page at
`src/pages/promo-lebaran.astro` answers `/promo-lebaran` and the
`[slug].astro` catch-all never sees it. The catch-all then owns every remaining
single-segment path: it resolves a CMS landing page, then a product redirect,
then falls through to 404.

**The collision this creates is real and silent.** If a native route and a CMS
landing page claim the same slug, the native file wins and the operator's page
becomes unreachable with no warning anywhere. Before adding a native route,
check `/admin/landing-pages` for that slug. This is the price of dropping the
prefix, and it is worth stating rather than discovering.

### The one exception: a landing page that *is* the product page

A landing page can take over its product's page (A21). When it does:

- `/produk/<product-slug>` renders the landing page, and that is its canonical
  address;
- its own `/<landing-slug>` answers `308` to the product URL, so exactly one
  URL is live and the two never compete as duplicate content;
- unpublishing it, or releasing the claim, hands `/produk/<product-slug>` back
  to the normal product template — the product never 404s because a landing
  page went away.

Only one landing page may hold a given product's page; the database enforces it
with a partial unique index rather than trusting the admin to remember. Set it
from the landing page list: **⋯ → Jadikan halaman produk**.

The hand-off is a rewrite carrying an `x-adsbook-product-page` header. Do not
reintroduce a check on `Astro.url` there: a rewrite does not carry the original
path, so the landing route sees its own slug either way, and reading the URL
sent the two routes into an endless redirect loop.

## Native Astro landing page — the flow

### 1. Decide the slug and the product

A landing page sells one product. Get its slug from `/admin/products` or from
`/produk`. Everything downstream — the form, the tracking payload, the catalog
identity — keys off that product.

### 2. Create the route

`src/pages/<slug>.astro` — at the root of `pages/`, so it answers
`domain.com/<slug>`. It must:

- render through `BaseLayout` so it inherits the header, footer, the 480 px
  column, tracking and the SEO chrome;
- resolve the product server-side and 404 through the shared page rather than a
  bare response:

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
import MetaLandingTracker from '../components/storefront/tracking/MetaLandingTracker.astro';
import GeoIpResolvedForm from '../components/storefront/forms/GeoIpResolvedForm.astro';
import { getStorefrontProduct } from '../lib/catalog';
import { catalogProductId } from '../lib/catalog-feed';
import '../styles/landing-pages/landing.css';

export const prerender = false;

const product = await getStorefrontProduct(Astro.locals, 'ganti-slug-produk');
if (!product) return Astro.rewrite('/404');
---

<BaseLayout
  title={`${product.productName} - ${Astro.locals.tenant.name}`}
  description={product.seoDescription}
  image={product.heroImage}
  hideHeader={false}
>
  <MetaLandingTracker
    slug="ganti-slug-produk"
    contentId={catalogProductId(product.productId)}
    contentName={product.productName}
    price={product.price}
  />

  <!-- sections here -->

  <GeoIpResolvedForm mode="hybrid" productSlug={product.slug} />
</BaseLayout>
```

`mode="hybrid"` is deliberate: the form decides between the short and the full
variant from the visitor's province, and an excluded province is forced to the
full form with COD disabled. Do not hard-code `middle` or `full` on a landing
page unless the offer genuinely requires it.

### 3. Put sections in components, not in the route

Static sections go in `src/components/storefront/landing-pages/` as `.astro`
files. Add a hydrated island only for real interaction — **there is no React on
the public surface** and a landing page is not the place to reintroduce it. A
gallery is `scroll-snap`; a countdown is a `<script>` tag.

### 4. Styles

- Reuse what exists first: the tokens in `src/styles/foundation.css`, the
  public rules in `storefront.css`, and the cva variants in `lib/ui-variants.ts`.
- `src/styles/landing-pages/landing.css` is the shared landing surface: the
  `.lp-section` rhythm, the type contract inside the column, and safe defaults
  for whatever an operator pastes (images, tables, blockquotes). Import it and
  build on it.
- Route-specific CSS goes in `src/styles/landing-pages/<slug>.css` and is
  imported **only** by that route. Never add landing rules to `foundation.css`
  (it ships to the admin too) or to `admin.css`.
- The column is 480 px and `BaseLayout` already owns it. Do not set another
  `max-width` on the page; style what goes *inside* the column.
- The type ramp is 10 · 11 · 12 · 13 · 14 · 15 · 16 · 18 · 20 · 24 · 28 px.
  Do not invent an intermediate size; the checkout stylesheet had fifteen and
  they were collapsed to seven for exactly this reason.
- **Weights are 400, 600 and 700 only.** Those are the three Inter faces that
  ship. `font-medium` renders identically to `font-normal`, and
  `font-extrabold` and `font-black` render identically to `font-bold` —
  measured, not assumed. Writing them is a lie in the source.
- One accent: `#C5A880`. One ink: `#111111`. One neutral family, warm
  (`#F8F7F4` surfaces on a `#f8f7f4` canvas, white reading column).

### 5. Verify before calling it done

```bash
npm run check     # astro check + tsc
npm test
npm run build
```

Then open it. A green build is not evidence a page renders — an unterminated
frontmatter block once shipped a live 404 while every static check passed.
Check at 390 CSS px:

- no horizontal scroll;
- the form reaches a shipping quote for a real district;
- zero console errors;
- the page is in `sitemap.xml` if it should be indexed, and carries a canonical.

## CMS landing page

Nothing to build. `/admin/landing-pages` composes ordered `html` and `form`
sections, previews them in a 480 px canvas, and serves them through the
catch-all. `?preview=1` renders an inactive page for an authenticated admin and
sends `Cache-Control: no-store`.

Reach for a native route only when the builder genuinely cannot express the
layout. A page an operator can edit without a deploy is worth more than a page
that is slightly prettier.

---

## Registering a native page in the CMS

Add an entry to `src/data/native-landing-pages.ts` and deploy. The CMS records
it on the next landing-page list load — no sync step, no admin action.

```ts
export const nativeLandingPages: NativeLandingPage[] = [
  {
    slug: 'promo-lebaran',        // must equal the route filename
    title: 'Promo Lebaran',       // shown in the CMS list
    productSlug: 'pupuk-organik', // the product this page sells
    description: 'Landing khusus kampanye Lebaran.',
    // isActive: false,           // registered, not yet linked
  },
];
```

**The file owns the page; the database owns only the operational state.** The
manifest decides that the page exists and what it says. `landing_pages` holds
one mirrored row per entry so the CMS can list it, link to it, and let an
operator hand it a product page — nothing more.

What follows from that:

- **The CMS cannot edit or delete a native page.** Both are refused with `409`
  and a message saying to change the file and redeploy. Deleting the row would
  only make it reappear on the next reconcile.
- **Removing the entry removes the row, and any product page it held.** A
  register entry without a file is a listing that 404s, so the reconcile drops
  it — and `/produk/<slug>` returns to the normal product template rather than
  pointing at nothing. Delete the entry and the file together.
- **An entry naming a product this store does not carry is skipped**, not
  inserted against an empty product, which would make the takeover unresolvable
  later.
- **The build refuses a register that misrepresents the site.** A duplicate
  slug, a slug that cannot match a filename, or a missing title, product, or
  description each fail `validateNativeLandingPages`.
- **Registering closes the shadowing hazard.** `landing_pages.slug` is UNIQUE,
  so once a native page is recorded an operator can no longer create a CMS page
  on the same slug and have Astro silently resolve it to the file instead.

### A native page as the product page

Same action as a CMS page — **⋯ → Jadikan halaman produk** — and the same
rules: `/produk/<product-slug>` renders it, its own slug answers `308` there,
and neither sitemap advertises the redirecting address. Only owner and admin
may set it.

The redirect for a native page lives in `src/middleware.ts`, not in the
catch-all: a native route is a real file and never reaches `[slug].astro`. The
middleware rules a request out in memory against the compiled register before
it touches the database, and skips the check when the request carries
`x-adsbook-product-page` — that header is how `/produk/<slug>` hands off, and
redirecting a hand-off is what put the two routes in a loop the first time A21
was built.

**Your canonical must come from `nativeLandingCanonicalPath`**, not from your
slug. A route cannot know on its own whether an operator has handed it a
product page, and declaring its own slug in that state points search engines at
a URL that bounces back to the page they are already on:

```astro
import { nativeLandingCanonicalPath } from '../lib/landing-pages';
const canonical = `${Astro.locals.tenant.siteUrl}${await nativeLandingCanonicalPath(Astro.locals, SLUG)}`;
```

---

## Start from the sample

`src/pages/contoh-landing.astro` is a complete working native landing page, with
its own `src/styles/landing-pages/contoh-landing.css`. It answers at
`/contoh-landing` on any install, because it binds to the store's **first
active product** rather than a hard-coded slug — this repository is cloned into
every store, so a named product would resolve on one and 404 on the rest.

Copy it, then make it yours:

1. `cp src/pages/contoh-landing.astro src/pages/<slug>.astro` and the stylesheet
   beside it.
2. Replace the `getStorefrontProducts` lookup with
   `getStorefrontProduct(Astro.locals, 'your-product-slug')`.
3. Rewrite the sections and the copy.
4. Register it in `src/data/native-landing-pages.ts` so the CMS records it.
5. **Delete `contoh-landing.astro`** before the store goes live, or it stays a
   public URL. It ships `noindex`, so a forgotten copy is at least never
   indexed as a real offer.

It deliberately shows the conditional pattern: benefit, key-point and review
sections render only when the product actually has that content, so a sparse
product produces a shorter page instead of empty headings.

## Writing one with an AI — the short version

Give this file to the assistant. The parts it will get wrong unprompted:

1. **Slug at the root.** `src/pages/<slug>.astro`, no prefix directory. Check
   `/admin/landing-pages` first so it does not shadow an operator's page, then
   add the entry to `src/data/native-landing-pages.ts` — a route without an
   entry answers on its URL but is invisible to the operator.
2. **The form follows the product, not the page.**
   `<GeoIpResolvedForm mode="hybrid" productSlug={product.slug} />` — the
   product is resolved server-side and everything downstream keys off it.
   Never hard-code prices, variants, or a product id in the markup.
3. **480 px, and `BaseLayout` already owns it.** Style inside the column.
4. **No React on the public surface.** A gallery is `scroll-snap`; a countdown
   is a `<script>` tag.
5. **Three weights, one ramp, one accent.** Anything else is invented.
6. **Canonical from `nativeLandingCanonicalPath`**, never from the slug.
7. **Verify by opening it at 390 px**, not by a green build. `npm run check`,
   `npm test`, `npm run build`, then look at the page and the console.
