 * it cannot — so a province this file does not know is a province where COD is
 * **allowed**, whatever the store disabled. That is only safe while every
 * province a buyer can actually reach checkout with resolves.
 *
 * The province list is not stable ground: Papua was split into six between
 * 2022 and 2024, and `indonesia-districts.ts` is external data (cahyadsn/wilayah,
 * Kepmendagri No. 300.2.2-2138/2025) that will be refreshed again. A refresh
 * that adds or renames a province while this list stays put silently opens COD
 * in a province the operator disabled, and nothing else would report it.
